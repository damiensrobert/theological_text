# Demonstration of the existence of a Theological trinity based on [the answer to the question : "What is philosophy? "](https://github.com/damiensrobert/philosophical_texts/)

## Reformulation of the question

I need to demonstrate that there exist something that I can imagine but that I cannot describe in every detail that constitute that thing.

## Corrolary of the definition

If i prove I can image infinity while imagining I am myself finite, I won !

## Demonstration

The answer is axiomatic and it can be explained in any different way !

Question : Why do you ask ?

Answer : Because it diverges ! But what is divergence anyway ?

CQFD.
